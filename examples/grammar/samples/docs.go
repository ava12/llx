/*
Package samples contains some grammars that can be parsed by llx, each grammar in a separate directory.
Each directory contains .grammar file containing grammar definition and two subdirectories:
"valid" containing valid source files and "invalid" containing source files that have syntax errors.

Source files may consist of multiple source samples, those file names have .txt suffix
(so as not to confuse smart IDE's).
