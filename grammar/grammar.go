/*
Package grammar contains data types used by LL(*) parser.

Grammar is represented in the form of nondeterministic state machine.
The machine uses stack holding current syntax tree node and its ancestor nodes together with their current states.

State contains map of transition rules (or ambiguous variants of rules).
A key is either a token type id, a literal id, or AnyToken value.
When parser tries to match a rule for current token the priorities are:
  - a literal id;
  - a token type id (unless the token text matches some reserved literal);
  - AnyToken.

Transition rule contains the next state index (or FinalState value
if parsing of current node is finished) and new node index
(or SameNode value if no nested node is pushed).

Each time parser enters FinalState it drops current node.

When a rule is applied:
  - if new node is SameNode:
  - current state is set to next state;
  - if matched rule key is not AnyToken: next token is read;
  - else:
  - new node and its initial state index are pushed;
